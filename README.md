# Raspberry Pi Pico W Booster Loader  

This is an advanced second-stage bootloader for the Raspberry Pi Pico W and the SidecarTridge Multidevice board. The current version is designed for the RP2040-based Pico W, but future releases will support the RP235x series and move beyond the Atari ST architecture.  

## Key Features  

- **OTA (Over-The-Air) Updates**  
  The Booster app fetches and installs the latest apps or microfirmwares from a web server, making it easy to manage and update multiple solutions on a single device.  

- **Web-Based Interface**  
  Access and manage the device via a web browser. The interface simplifies app installation, updates, and system configuration without the need for additional software.  

- **Micro SD Card Support**  
  Store and manage files on a micro SD card, allowing apps to use external storage or turn the device into a file server.  

- **Mass Storage Mode**  
  The device can function as a USB mass storage device for easy file transfers.  

- **Multi-App Support**  
  Install and manage multiple app or microfirmwares simultaneously, ensuring flexible and dynamic usage.  

- **External Display Support**  
  Connect an external screen or run headless. Currently supports **Atari ST high and low resolutions**, with easy expansion to other display types.  

- **Global Settings**  
  Store system-wide configurations in flash memory, accessible via the web interface or terminal.  

## Booster components  

The Booster app is designed to be modular and extendable. The key components include:  

- **Booster Core**  
  The heart of the system, responsible for managing the device, loading/unloading apps, handling the micro SD card, and providing the web interface.  

- **Placeholder App**  
  A temporary app that runs when no other app is installed. It hands control over to the Booster Core and is replaced when an active app is loaded.  

- **Global Settings**  
  Stored in flash memory, these settings apply to the entire device and its apps.  

- **Local Settings**  
  Each app has its own isolated configuration stored in flash memory, ensuring app-specific settings remain independent.

- **Atari ST firmware**  
  The Booster app uses the Atari ST computer as the terminal for screen and keyboard input/output. A small custom firmware is included to handle the Atari ST's unique hardware and protocols.

## Memory Map  

The Pico W and Pico 2W feature a **2MB flash memory**, structured as follows:

```

The **Booster Core** resides in **flash memory from 0x10120000 (768K)**. This region is only modified when updating the core itself.  

The **Config Flash (120K at 0x101E0000)** stores per-app settings, allowing up to **30 microfirmware apps**, each allocated **4K of flash memory**.  

A **Global Lookup Table (4K at 0x101FE000)** maps microfirmware apps to their configuration sectors using unique UUIDs.  

Finally, the **Global Settings (4K at 0x101FF000)** store system-wide configurations for the device and its microfirmware apps.  

Each **microfirmware app is loaded at 0x10000000** after powering on the device. It can be updated over the air or through the web interface.  

This design ensures efficient memory usage while providing a structured and extensible platform for managing multiple apps and configurations on the Raspberry Pi Pico W. ðŸš€ developement section.

## Booster Quickstart Guide

### Initial Factory Configuration for SidecarTridge Multidevice on Atari ST Series Computers

1. Format a microSD card with either **exFAT** or **FAT32** file system and insert it into the SidecarTridge Multidevice board.

2. Plug the SidecarTridge Multidevice into the **cartridge port** of your Atari ST series computer.

3. Power on the Atari ST computer.

4. The Booster app will automatically start in **Factory (Fabric) mode**, showing the following message on screen:

   ![Booster Factory Mode step 1](/docs/BOOSTER-FABRIC-1.png)

   This screen confirms that the Booster app is running in Factory mode and is ready to be configured.  
   Scan the **QR code** with your smartphone to connect to the WiFi network created by the Booster app, or manually connect via your WiFi settings.  
   The default network details are:
   - **SSID**: `SIDECART`  
   - **Password**: `sidecart`

5. Once connected to the WiFi, the Booster app will detect the connection and show the following screen:

   ![Booster Factory Mode step 2](/docs/BOOSTER-FABRIC-2.png)

   This screen invites you to open a web browser and navigate to either:
   - `http://sidecart.local`  
   - or `http://192.168.4.1` (if `.local` domains arenâ€™t supported)

6. In your web browser, enter the URL shown above to access the web interface.  
   Youâ€™ll be prompted to configure your home or office WiFi network.  
   Select your WiFi SSID from the list (you can click **Refresh** if it doesnâ€™t appear), then click it to continue.  
   In this example, the network is `CHISMEROUTER`.

   ![Booster Factory Mode step 3](/docs/BOOSTER-FABRIC-3.png)

7. Enter your WiFi password and click the **Connect** button.

   ![Booster Factory Mode step 4](/docs/BOOSTER-FABRIC-4.png)

8. The Booster app will save the WiFi credentials to flash memory and reboot.  
   It will then connect to your WiFi network and show this message:

   ![Booster Factory Mode step 5](/docs/BOOSTER-FABRIC-5.png)

   Meanwhile, the device will also display a reboot message on the Atari screen:

   ![Booster Factory Mode step 6](/docs/BOOSTER-FABRIC-6.png)

9. After rebooting, the Booster app will attempt to connect to your configured WiFi network:

   ![Booster Manager Mode step 1](/docs/BOOSTER-MANAGER-1.png)

10. Once connected successfully, the screen will show:

    ![Booster Maneger Mode step 2](/docs/BOOSTER-MANAGER-2.png)

    Your WiFi setup is now complete. From now on, the Booster app will boot directly into **Manager mode**.  
    See the next section for details on using Manager mode.
