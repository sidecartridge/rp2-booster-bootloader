# Booster is ALWAYS compiled MinSizeRel, debug included. It has one 768K slot to

# _DEBUG=1 -- DPRINTF over UART, no --strip-all -- and not by optimisation
# level. MinSizeRel still carries -g, so the symbols are there to debug with;
# it also carries -DNDEBUG, so assert() is off in debug builds too.
# `release` maps here too: -O3 overflows the slot by ~48KB and will not link,
# which is why the root build.sh already asks for MinSizeRel (D-04). Doing it
