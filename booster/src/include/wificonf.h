 * Description: The .wificonf file on the microSD card (EPIC-10, D-09)
 *
 * Read at every Booster boot, factory and Manager alike, before WiFi starts.
 * While the file is on the card it is the WiFi configuration: what it says is
 * applied to the global settings, and flash is written only when a value
 * actually changed. Remove the file to manage WiFi from the web UI again.
