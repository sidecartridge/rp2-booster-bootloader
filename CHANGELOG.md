# Changelog

## v2.4.0 (2026-08-17) - release

Firmware only. Installs and firmware updates are far more reliable, show real progress while they run, and the firmware update now checks the download before installing it.

### New features
- **You can see what an install is doing.** A progress bar with a percentage and size, the stage it has reached, and the name of the microfirmware being installed. It returns to the Apps page on its own when finished.
- **Failed installs tell you why, and can be retried.** The page shows the reason and offers Retry or Cancel instead of a generic error page.
- **Firmware updates are checked before installing.** The downloaded firmware is verified against a checksum published with it, and the update is refused if it does not match. It is also refused if the checksum is missing, so a damaged or incomplete download can never be flashed.
- The firmware update page shows the same live progress, instead of a fixed two minute wait.

### Fixes
- Microfirmwares hosted on GitHub releases and similar services now install correctly. Downloads follow redirects, and an error page can never be saved as a microfirmware.
- Installs no longer fail at random. A download that used to fail once and work on a later attempt now works first time.
- The device no longer freezes while installing.
- Browsing the web interface during a download can no longer corrupt the SD card.
- A dropped connection is retried instead of failing the whole install.
- Several installs in a row no longer slow down or stall.
- A failed firmware update used to report "No error". It now shows the real reason.
- The progress page no longer shows the size of the previous download.
- The banners at the top of a page no longer all flash into view while it loads.
- Copyright notices read 2024-2026 and match on every page.

### Build
- Releases publish `upgrade.md5` alongside `upgrade.bin`.
- The `fatfs-sdk` and `pico-extras` references now match the versions the build scripts use.

## v2.3.0 (2026-08-02) - release

This release moves downloads to HTTPS and the apps catalog to the new SidecarTridge store. The Apps page gains filters for who made a microfirmware and how tested it is, and developers get a way to deploy a microfirmware over WiFi without a debug probe.

### New features
- Downloads now work over both `http://` and `https://` from a single firmware image, chosen per request from the URL scheme. Microfirmware installs and the firmware OTA both use it.
- The version check and the firmware OTA now use `https://` by default.
- The apps catalog has moved to `https://md-store.sidecartridge.com/atari-st/apps.json`.
- Each microfirmware on the Apps page now shows who made it, and a **Creator** filter sits alongside Platform and Features. Creators who publish a website get a small link icon on their filter chip. Microfirmwares published without creator information are shown as SidecarTridge.
- New **Release type** filter on the Apps page: **All**, **Stable** and **Beta**. Stable hides beta versions, Beta shows only beta versions, and All shows everything. It filters the list you already have, and does not change which catalog is loaded.
- **Deploy API for microfirmware developers.** A `.uf2` can be pushed to the device over WiFi and launched with two `curl` calls, instead of needing a debug probe or the USB/BOOTSEL dance. It is off unless you install the DEV APP and stay on the Development channel, and a red banner appears on every page while it is on. Documented in [`docs/DEPLOY-API.md`](docs/DEPLOY-API.md), including a Makefile target. See the security note below before enabling it.

### Changes
- Booster is built as `MinSizeRel` for release flows. Linking TLS costs about 121 KB of flash, and `-O3` no longer fits the 768 KB slot.
- The Stable and Beta buttons on the Apps page used to switch catalog and reload the page, quietly rewriting your saved catalog setting. They now only filter, and the Config page is the single place that chooses the catalog.
- The catalog options on the Config page say what each one is for: `Stable - Tested release (default)`, `Testing - unstable releases`, `Development - Local development only`.
- Official creators are listed first in the **Creator** filter.
- The build scripts now stop at the first failure. A failed compile or link used to be stepped over, so a build could report success while packaging firmware left over from an earlier run, or produce no firmware at all.
- Debug builds are compiled with the same size optimisation as release builds and differ only in their debug logging. A debug build previously overflowed the flash slot and never linked at all.
- The Atari ST terminal firmware is rebuilt on every build, including in CI, where it was being skipped without any error.
- Devices already using one of the standard catalog channels are switched to the new store automatically on upgrade. A custom catalog URL is never modified.
- The Development channel now points at the new store and works. The Beta channel points there too but the store does not publish that catalog yet, so selecting it shows an empty list until it does.

### Fixes
- The **WiFi power** setting now defaults to **No Powersave**, an always-on radio. It previously defaulted to Disabled PM, which also disables power saving but leaves the radio's listen intervals in place. Existing devices keep whatever they have configured; this only changes new devices and factory resets.

### Security
- **HTTPS on the device is encrypted but not authenticated.** Certificates are not verified: the device has no CA bundle and no real-time clock, so certificate validity cannot be checked. Downloads it performs itself — microfirmware binaries and the firmware OTA — are protected against passive eavesdropping on the network, but **not** against an active man-in-the-middle who can substitute content. Do not treat an `https://` binary URL as proof of origin. (The apps catalog is fetched by your browser rather than the device, so it does get normal certificate verification.)
- The MD5 check on a downloaded microfirmware is an integrity check, not a signature. It confirms the stored bytes match what the catalog said to expect, catching truncation and corruption. Because the expected hash arrives from the same catalog over the same connection as the binary, it does not establish authenticity.
- **The developer deploy API is not authenticated.** While it is enabled, anyone who can reach the device on your network can install and run code on it, and that code runs on a cartridge attached to your Atari's bus. The web UI is served over plain `http`, so the connection is not protected either. Requiring the DEV APP to be installed and the Development channel to be selected makes switching it on deliberate and visible; it is not a security boundary. Enable it only on a network you trust, and switch it off when you are done. An uploaded binary is not hash-checked, because the catalog's MD5 describes the placeholder it replaced.
- Verified certificates remain planned but are not in this release.

## v2.2.0 (2026-04-20) - release

This release lets users pick which version of a microfirmware to install — including older ones when the publisher keeps them online — and switch between Stable and Beta catalog channels from the Apps page.

### Changes
- Replace the Download/Update buttons on the Apps page with a single context-aware action button (Install / Update / Downgrade).
- Replace the Apps catalog URL text input on the Config page with a channel dropdown (Stable / Beta / Development / Custom).
- Show a loading indicator while the apps catalog is being fetched.

### New features
- Add an optional `previous_versions` array to entries in `apps.json`, backwards compatible with existing catalogs.
- Add a per-app version selector defaulting to the latest, with downgrades requiring an explicit confirmation.
- Add a Stable/Beta channel switcher on the Apps page that updates the catalog URL and reloads on click.

### Fixes
- Compare versions using a semantic-version comparator instead of string equality.

## v2.1.0 (2026-03-24) - release

This release delivers a smoother overall user experience, with a cleaner Manager interface on both the Atari ST screen and the web UI, better behavior when WiFi is unavailable, fixes for some network issues in weak WiFi environments, and major flash-usage optimizations behind the scenes.

### Changes
- Reduced flash usage across Booster and the embedded Upgrader with targeted code-size optimizations, smaller display primitives, and streamlined helper code.
- Minify the Manager web assets before generating `fsdata_srv.c`, and refactor repeated page content to reduce the embedded web payload size.
- Add automatic flash usage reporting to the Booster build and stop the build if the generated image exceeds the available flash slot.
- Accept `MinSizeRel` explicitly in the build scripts, and always build the Upgrader in `MinSizeRel` for `release` and `minsizerel` flows.

### New features
- Add an offline Manager mode: if WiFi connection retries are exhausted, Booster keeps running without network features and still allows manual boot of already-downloaded microfirmwares from the Atari ST terminal path.
- Allow launching installed apps directly from the Atari ST terminal, including the ESC-to-apps and SHIFT-to-GEMDOS workflow for manual booting.
- Show signal strength and MAC address information in both the Atari ST Manager screen and the shared system information panel in the web UI.
- Re-enable ICMP ping replies for easier network diagnostics and compatibility checks.
- Add responsive Platform and Features filters to the Apps page so users can narrow the available microfirmwares dynamically from the downloaded catalog.
- Update the integrated Atari ST terminal firmware and embedded Upgrader image used by Booster.

### Fixes
- Improve SELECT-button debouncing for long presses so factory reset is more reliable.
- Fix several WiFi stability issues, including reconnect memory pressure, polling behavior, multi-connection handling, and weaker-signal network environments.
- Harden MD5 parsing for downloaded app metadata by validating the input length before converting it from JSON.
- Polish Manager copy, status messaging, and minor header consistency issues found during PR review.

## v2.0.9 (2025-12-20) - release

This release now shows the MAC address to help users to configure their home router filters.

### Changes
- Show the WiFi countries as a drop down list instead of a text input, to avoid invalid country codes.
- Show the available power WiFi network options as a drop down list instead of a text input, to avoid invalid power values.
- Show the range of SD baud rate values (KB/s) as a drop down list instead of a text input, to avoid invalid speed values.
- Shows the MAC address always on the Atari ST connection screen, even if the device is not connected to a WiFi network.

### New features
- Shows the MAC address of the Pico W in the Atari ST screen and system information banner at the bottom of the web pages.
- Added AGENTS.md file with instructions for AI agentic development. 

### Fixes
- The DMA memory copy to ROM in RAM gets the number of bytes to copy instead of words. For consistency with the microfirmwares.

## v2.0.7beta (2025-10-07) - Beta release

This is the second beta release. It includes all the new features and improvements for the version 2.0.x, and it will not include any more new features but only fixes and small improvements. The code is still in development and may contain bugs, but it is stable and ready to use for all users.

### Changes
- **Link to the Report Issues page**: A link to the Report Issues page has been added to the web app at the bottom of the page. This makes it easier for users to report any issues they encounter while using the app.

### New features
- **New ./notreboot file**: A new `./notreboot` file has been introduced. If this file is present on the microSD card, the device will not reboot automatically if the user performs a reset to the factory settings. This feature is useful during the development and testing phases, because combined with the `./wificonf` file, it allows to test the device without the need to reconfigure the WiFi settings after each reset.

### Fixes
No fixes in this release.

## v2.0.6beta (2025-08-14) - Beta release

This is the first beta release. It includes all the new features and improvements for the version 2.0.x, and it will not include any more new features. The code is still in development and may contain bugs, but it is more stable than previous alpha releases and ready to use for all users.

### Changes
- **Show information in the web app when launched app**: The web app will now display relevant information and tips when launched, helping users to get started quickly and easily.
- **Removed USB Mass Storage support**: The USB Mass Storage feature has been removed. Now, to use the Mass storage mode the user has to launch the File Manager or Multi-drive microfirmwares.
- **Disable ICMP ping responses**: ICMP ping responses have been disabled for improved reliability.
- **Better network deinitialization**: The network deinitialization process has been improved to avoid the network to stuck when changing from the "Factory" mode to the "Booster" mode.

### New features
- **Firmware update notifications**: The web app will now notify users when a new firmware update is available.
- **Firmware upgrade process**: The firmware upgrade process has been streamlined for easier updates. Now the users can initiate the upgrade process directly from the web app, without needing to manually download and install firmware files.
- **mDNS support**: The web app now supports mDNS (Multicast DNS), allowing for easier discovery and connection to devices on the local network. Now the site "sidecart.local" is accessible via mDNS. Previously it was only through DHCP plus DNS, which small routers from telecom providers often struggle with.

### Fixes
