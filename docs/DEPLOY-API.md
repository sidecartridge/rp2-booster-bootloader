# Developer deploy API

Push a microfirmware `.uf2` to a Booster device over WiFi and run it, without a debug probe
and without the USB/BOOTSEL dance.

This exists for people writing microfirmwares. If you are not writing one, you do not need
it, and you should leave it switched off.

## Read this first

**The API is not authenticated.** While it is enabled, anyone who can reach the device on
the network can install and run code on it, and that code runs on a cartridge plugged into
your Atari's bus. The web UI is served over plain `http`, so there is nothing to protect
the connection either.

What the gate below gives you is that switching it on is deliberate, obvious, and easy to
undo. It is not a security boundary. Enable it on a network you trust, and switch it off
when you are done.

## Turning it on

Two conditions must both hold. They are checked by the firmware on every request.

1. **Install the DEV APP.** Go to Config, set the release catalog to
   `Development - Local development only`, then install `DEV APP` from the Apps page like
   any other microfirmware.
2. **Stay on the Development channel.** The catalog setting must remain the development
   catalog while you are using the API.

When both hold, every Manager page shows a red **DEVELOPMENT MODE** banner. That banner is
the ground truth: if it is not there, the API is not answering.

### Turning it off

Either switch the release catalog to something other than Development, or delete the DEV
APP from the Apps page. Either one closes the gate immediately. Deleting the DEV APP also
deletes your upload.

> **If your uploads suddenly stop working, check the channel.** Switching to Stable or Beta
> to look something up disables the API until you switch back. This is deliberate, and it
> is the most likely reason a command that worked five minutes ago now fails.

## The two calls

### Upload

```
POST /dev_upload.cgi
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Body: the raw .uf2
```

```sh
curl --fail --data-binary @build/myapp.uf2 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
     "http://sidecart.local/dev_upload.cgi"
```

The body is written to the SD card as `/apps/44444444-4444-4444-8444-444444444444.dev.uf2`,
next to the DEV APP's own files. Nothing is flashed yet.

Send a real `Content-Length` — `curl --data-binary` does. The firmware compares it against
what actually arrives and **refuses to commit a short transfer**, so a dropped connection
leaves your previous binary intact rather than a truncated one that would brick the
microfirmware slot on the next launch.

The upload replaces the previous one. There is no versioning and no undo. Reinstalling the
DEV APP from the catalog keeps your upload.

### Launch

```
GET /mngr_launchapp.cgi?uuid=44444444-4444-4444-8444-444444444444
```

```sh
curl --fail "http://sidecart.local/mngr_launchapp.cgi?uuid=44444444-4444-4444-8444-444444444444"
```

With an upload on the card, this programs it into the microfirmware slot and reboots into
it. The device drops off the network while it does so. That is the microfirmware taking
over, not a failure.

Without an upload, launching leaves the microfirmware slot untouched and boots whatever is
already in it. That is the debug probe workflow: flash your microfirmware with the probe,
then launch the DEV APP from the Apps page or with the call above. The placeholder binary
that installing the DEV APP downloads is never programmed into the slot.

To go from uploads back to the probe, delete the DEV APP, which removes the upload, and
install it again.

### Starting again from a clean slate

If a deploy leaves the device in a bad state, return to Booster and open the Apps page. The
DEV APP card has a **Restore and launch** button. After you confirm, it:

1. deletes your upload,
2. erases the DEV APP's saved settings,
3. writes the DEV APP version downloaded from the catalog into the microfirmware slot,
4. launches it.

Today that catalog version is a placeholder that hands control straight back to Booster, so
a restore leaves you in Booster with nothing of yours left on the device. Upload again to
carry on.

To reset only your microfirmware's saved settings, use **Restore config only** on the same
card instead. It erases the DEV APP's settings and nothing else: the microfirmware in the
slot and your upload stay, and nothing is launched. Your next launch starts with default
settings.

Both restore buttons are only offered on the web page. They are not part of this API.

`44444444-4444-4444-8444-444444444444` is the fixed UUID of the development app. It is not
a placeholder for you to change.

### Getting back to Booster

Press the **SELECT** button on the device and follow the instructions on the Atari screen.
The deploy API belongs to Booster, so it is not reachable while your microfirmware is
running.

## Makefile

```make
DEVICE ?= sidecart.local
DEV_UUID = 44444444-4444-4444-8444-444444444444
UF2      = build/myapp.uf2

.PHONY: deploy upload launch

deploy: upload launch

upload: $(UF2)
	@echo "Uploading $(UF2) to $(DEVICE)..."
	@curl --fail --silent --show-error \
	      --data-binary @$(UF2) \
	      -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" \
	      "http://$(DEVICE)/dev_upload.cgi"

launch:
	@echo "Launching on $(DEVICE)..."
	@curl --fail --silent --show-error \
	      "http://$(DEVICE)/mngr_launchapp.cgi?uuid=$(DEV_UUID)"
```

Then `make deploy` after a build. Override the host with `make deploy DEVICE=192.168.1.50`
if mDNS is not working on your network.

`--fail` matters: without it `curl` exits 0 on an HTTP error, and `make deploy` would
cheerfully launch a binary that never uploaded.

## When it does not work

| Symptom | Cause |
| --- | --- |
| Upload refused, no banner on the web pages | The gate is shut. Check both conditions: DEV APP installed, Development channel selected |
| Worked before, fails now | You almost certainly changed the release catalog. Switch it back |
| Upload refused immediately on a large file | The `.uf2` is bigger than the microfirmware slot allows |
| Upload appears to work, launch runs the old binary | The transfer was short and was rejected rather than committed. Check `curl` exited 0 |
| Launch overwrites the microfirmware you flashed with the probe | An upload is still on the card, and it is flashed at every launch. Delete the DEV APP and install it again to remove it |
| After updating Booster to v2.4.2, launch runs the old microfirmware instead of your upload | Uploads made with v2.3.0 to v2.4.1 were stored under the catalog binary's name, which is no longer flashed. Upload again |
| Nothing responds at `sidecart.local` | mDNS. Use the IP address shown on the Atari screen |

## What this does not do

- **No integrity check.** The MD5 in the catalog describes the DEV APP's placeholder
  binary, not your upload, so there is nothing to verify an uploaded file against.
  Structure is checked when flashing, contents are not.
- **No arbitrary UUIDs.** Only the development app can be replaced this way. Installing
  real microfirmwares still goes through the catalog.
- **No rollback.** Recover a bad upload by uploading a good one, or use **Restore and
  launch** on the DEV APP card to go back to the version downloaded from the catalog.
