# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

`AGENTS.md` is the authoritative agent guide for this repo and contains detailed workflow rules. Read it before non-trivial work. This file summarizes the parts that matter most day-to-day.

## Backlog

`docs/epics/` holds the iteration/epic/story/task backlog for the current development cycle and is **gitignored** (local-only; the tracked `docs/*.png` screenshots are unaffected). Read `docs/epics/README.md` for the conventions, `ITERATIONS.md` for what the current cycle is trying to do, and `DECISIONS.md` for the standing `D-NN` decisions and `C-NN` constraints — cite those rather than re-deriving them. Regenerate the dashboard with `./docs/epics/cockpit.sh` after changing any epic or story.

Work is strictly sequential: one epic at a time on an `epic-NN-<slug>` branch, commits tagged `(EPIC-NN STORY-NN)`, and work STOPS after each epic for Diego's hardware verification before anything merges.

## Build commands

Always drive builds from the repo root — it copies `version.txt` into each subproject and orchestrates the four sub-builds in the right order.

```sh
./build.sh pico_w debug         # iterating
./build.sh pico_w release       # release UF2 only
./build.sh pico_w release final # also produces -full.uf2, upgrade.bin, SIDECARTVERSION
./build.sh pico_w minsizerel    # MinSizeRel build (Upgrader is always MinSizeRel for release/minsizerel)
```

Artifacts land in `dist/` as `rp-booster-<version>[-build_type][-full].uf2`.

The third argument is only tested for emptiness — any value turns on the full-image step. CI passes `image`; the docs use `final`. Only `final` (or empty) keeps `booster/`/`upgrader/` reading `version.txt`; any other value makes them look for `version-<arg>.txt`, which does not exist in the repo.

First-time setup:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Toolchain: CMake, Python 3, `arm-none-eabi-*`, and **Perl** (the Booster CMake aborts without it — it drives web-asset generation). The `term/atarist/` build also requires the `stcmd` tooling (AtariST Toolkit Docker image).

Flash for quick validation: `picotool load -xv dist/rp-booster-<version>.uf2`.

There is no test suite — "done" means a clean root build plus on-device verification (see AGENTS.md §"What 'done' looks like"). CI parity is what PR builds run:

```sh
./build.sh pico_w release image
./build.sh pico_w debug
```

## Build pipeline (important coupling)

`build.sh` runs four sub-builds, in order, and the first three feed headers into the fourth:

1. **`upgrader/`** → builds `upgrader.bin`, runs `firmware.py` to emit `upgrader_firmware.h`, copies it into `booster/src/include/upgrader_firmware.h`. Always built for board `pico` (not `pico_w`) to shrink the footprint.
2. **`term/atarist/`** → builds the Atari ST terminal firmware via `stcmd`, pads to 2 KB, runs `firmware.py` to emit `term_firmware.h`, copies it into `booster/src/include/term_firmware.h`.
3. **`booster/`** → main firmware, depends on the two generated headers above.
4. **`placeholder/`** → minimal app used when no microfirmware is installed. Also built for board `pico`.

Then `build_uf2.py` combines `placeholder.uf2` + `booster.uf2` into the shipping UF2; with a third arg, `merge_uf2.py` also produces the full image and `upgrade.bin`.

**Implication:** if you change `upgrader/` or `term/atarist/`, you must rebuild from the root (or rerun those sub-builds) so Booster picks up refreshed headers. Don't hand-edit the generated headers in `booster/src/include/`.

The sub-build scripts (`booster/build.sh`, `placeholder/build.sh`, `upgrader/build.sh`) **`cd ..` and run `git submodule update` plus `git checkout tags/...`** to pin SDK versions (currently pico-sdk 2.2.0, pico-extras sdk-2.2.0, fatfs-sdk v3.6.2). Treat any root build as potentially mutating the working tree — warn the user and confirm how to protect in-progress work before invoking it.

`build.sh` also `rm -rf build` at the start of each run, as does each sub-build script in its own directory.

### Generated-but-tracked files

These are build outputs that live in the source tree and are committed. Never hand-edit them; regenerate by building.

- `booster/src/fsdata_srv.c` — web assets, minified and packed by `external/generate_fsdata.pl` + `external/makefsdata`. The CMake custom command re-runs whenever anything under `booster/src/fs/` changes.
- `booster/src/include/upgrader_firmware.h`, `booster/src/include/term_firmware.h` — see pipeline above.

### Build-time configuration

`booster/build.sh` exports environment variables that `booster/src/CMakeLists.txt` turns into compile definitions. Changing behavior here means editing the build script, not just CMake:

- `DEBUG_MODE` → `_DEBUG`. Set to 1 **only** for `debug` builds. USB stdio is always off; UART stdio is enabled only when `_DEBUG != 0`, and release builds additionally get `--gc-sections --strip-all`. All logging goes through `DPRINTF` (`booster/src/include/debug.h`) and vanishes in release.
- `DISPLAY_ATARIST=1` — compiles in the Atari ST display/terminal path.
- `PICO_FLASH_ASSUME_CORE0_SAFE=1` — asserts core 1 never writes flash.
- `RELEASE_VERSION` / `RELEASE_DATE` / `RELEASE_TYPE` — stamped into the binary.

Downloads speak **both http and https from a single build**, chosen per request from the URL scheme (`httpc_scheme_is_https()`); there is no compile flag for it. mbedTLS and lwIP ALTCP are always linked, which is most of why Booster ships as `MinSizeRel` — see the flash budget note under Constraints. TLS is encryption-only (`ALTCP_MBEDTLS_AUTHMODE` is `MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_NONE`): there is no CA bundle and no wall clock, so certificates are not verified. Don't describe it as authenticated.

Board types accepted by Booster's CMake: `pico_w` (default and the shipping target), `pico`, `sidecartos_16mb`.

## Architecture

The device is a Raspberry Pi Pico W on a SidecarTridge cartridge plugged into an Atari ST. Four firmware components share one 2 MB flash:

```
0x10000000  MICROFIRMWARE APP (1152K)   — active microfirmware (replaceable, OTA)
0x10120000  BOOSTER CORE     (768K)     — manager firmware, web UI, OTA, SD
0x101E0000  CONFIG FLASH     (120K)     — 30 × 4K per-app config sectors
0x101FE000  GLOBAL LOOKUP    (4K)       — UUID → config sector mapping
0x101FF000  GLOBAL SETTINGS  (4K)       — device-wide config
```

The placeholder app occupies the microfirmware slot when nothing is installed and just hands control back to Booster.

`main.c` dispatches on the `PARAM_BOOT_FEATURE` global setting: `FABRIC` (or absent) enters factory setup, anything else forces the value to `BOOSTER` and enters Manager mode. Naming to watch — the code and files say **fabric**; the README, UI, and user docs call the same mode **factory**.

`appsremote/apps.json` is the microfirmware catalog format (uuid, binary URL, md5, version) that Manager mode fetches for OTA installs.

## Constraints to respect

- **Real-time path is hot.** Cartridge protocol parsing happens in PIO/DMA/IRQ context. Keep handlers tiny: capture state, set flags, defer work to the main loop.
- **Static buffers, bounded sizes.** Avoid dynamic allocation in hot paths. Watch RP2040 stack usage.
- **Memory map is load-bearing.** Booster, placeholder, config sectors, lookup table, and global settings all assume the layout in `memmap_booster.ld`. Changing offsets means coordinated changes in the linker script, the build's flash-usage report, OTA, and the upgrader.
- **Flash budget is tight.** Release builds use `MinSizeRel` for the upgrader and the build aborts if Booster exceeds its slot. When adding code or web assets, keep an eye on the size report.
- **Style:** follow `.clang-format` and `.clang-tidy` for any C/C++ you touch. Don't introduce new clang-tidy warnings.

## Non-destructive workflow (from AGENTS.md)

The user often edits files while an agent is running. Treat the working tree as the source of truth.

**Never run without explicit user approval:** `git restore`, `git checkout -- <path>`, `git reset` (any form), `git clean`, or `git submodule update` / submodule SHA changes. Note again that the sub-build scripts do submodule updates and tag checkouts internally — flag this before invoking `./build.sh`.

`secrets.sh` is gitignored and holds live AWS credentials for the release upload. Never read it into output, commit it, or echo its contents.
